Create an arcade-style video game using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without importing any external libraries or assets. You cannot use images or SVGs.

Game Concept: A spaceship is traveling through a dense asteroid field. The player must navigate the spaceship to avoid colliding with asteroids while simultaneously shooting and destroying them.

Specific Requirements:

Visuals (Challenging due to no images/SVGs):

Design an impressive and visually appealing game using only HTML elements and CSS styling. Aim for a retro-futuristic aesthetic.

The spaceship should have animated propellant being expelled from its rear, with the animation varying based on movement (e.g., longer flames for forward thrust).

The background should simulate a starfield, with stars at different depths moving at different parallax speeds to enhance the illusion of forward motion.

Asteroids should vary in size, speed, and rotational velocity. They should have distinct, recognizable shapes despite being created with pure HTML/CSS.

When an asteroid is destroyed, it should break into smaller fragments that also need to be avoided or shot.

Create a visually distinct and animated laser beam effect when the spaceship shoots.


Gameplay Mechanics (Added complexity):

The spaceship should be controllable using keyboard input, allowing movement in all four directions (up, down, left, right) with smooth acceleration and deceleration. The controls should feel responsive and intuitive.

The spaceship should have a limited number of lives, indicated visually on the screen.

The player can shoot lasers to destroy asteroids. There should be a limited rate of fire (e.g., a cooldown period between shots) and a visual indicator (e.g., a recharging bar) for the weapon.

Collisions between the spaceship and asteroids or asteroid fragments result in the loss of a life. The collision detection needs to be accurate, accounting for the irregular shapes of both the spaceship and asteroids.

Implement a scoring system that increases with each destroyed asteroid, with larger asteroids or fragments awarding more points.

The game should increase in difficulty over time, with asteroid frequency, speed, and size increasing as the player progresses.

Implement a game over screen that displays the player's final score and allows them to restart the game.


Code Structure (Challenging for a single file):

All the code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) must be contained within a single HTML file.

The JavaScript code should be well-organized, modular, and thoroughly commented to explain the logic and implementation.

Ensure the game is performant and runs smoothly even with a large number of asteroids and fragments on the screen.


Bonus Challenge:

Add a "hyperspace" ability that allows the spaceship to teleport to a random location, but with a small chance of malfunctioning and placing the ship directly in the path of an asteroid. This should have a limited number of uses or a recharge time.


Provide all the code within a single HTML file.
